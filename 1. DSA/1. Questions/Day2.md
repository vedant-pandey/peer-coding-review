## II. Magic number

Given an integer A, find and return the Ath magic number.

A magic number is defined as a number which can be expressed as a power of 5 or sum of unique powers of 5.

First few magic numbers are 5, 25, 30(5 + 25), 125, 130(125 + 5), â€¦.

### Problem Constraints

1 <= A <= 5000

---

### Input Format

The only argument given is integer A.

---

### Output Format

Return the Ath magic number.

---

### Example Input

Example Input 1:

``A = 3``

Example Input 2:

``A = 10``

---

### Example Output

Example Output 1:

``30``

Example Output 2:

``650``

---

### Example Explanation

Explanation 1:

```
A in increasing order is [5, 25, 30, 125, 130, ...] 3rd element in this is 30
```

Explanation 2:

```
In the sequence shown in explanation 1, 10th element will be 650.
```
